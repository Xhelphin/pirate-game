## How to use
### Installation

### How to play
To play the game, you will need the pirate game sheets from TES and the HTML file in this repo. On the page you will see a square, a grid of squares and 4 buttons.  
#### Empty Square
The empty square will show the last square that was selected, either randomly or manually.  
#### Grid
The grid shows the squares that can be chosen by random or from the list. Squares will be white if they have not been selected and red if they have.  
#### Buttons and list
The buttons at the bottom of the page shows 4 buttons.    
The first button (labelled `Next Square`) will randomly pick a square to play.  
The next button (labelled `Choose Square`) will enable the list and button below it for you to manually pick a square to be played.  
The next button (labelled `Undo Move`) will undo whichever square was last selected. This button can be used as many times in a row as needed.  
The last button on this line (labelled `New Game`) will reset the grid so that you can play a new game.  
When you press `Choose Square` you can click on a square to play it.
